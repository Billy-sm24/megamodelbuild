# Placeholder syntax for an orientation model! 
# Each (not always-authoritative) model in the megamodel has a unique line, identified by its prefix
# Rest of line is space-separated entries. The first is y or n for whether this model is authoritative.
# The rest are identifiers for the (hyper)edges that have this model as target.
# This one is Figure 3b. Some tests will splat it onto orientation.txt, which the current framework
# has hardcoded as the location of the current orientation model. 
# TODO: think about best way to handle that for serious use.
