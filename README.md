# Megamodelbuild

This project contains an early-stage demonstration of building on top of the pluto build system to enable sound, flexible and optimal building from megamodels. It demonstrates the examples from the paper 

Towards Sound, Optimal and Flexible Building from Megamodels by me, Perdita Stevens, in MODELS'18,

of which you can find a preprint at my home page (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/perdita/MegamodelBuild). See the paper,
and the READMEs and comments in the various directories, for more information.
